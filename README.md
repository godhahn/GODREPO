# GODREPO
## GODREPO is a repository where I experiment and develop small projects during downtime. These projects are crafted using Python and Streamlit, integrating with the Groq API and LLaMA models to enhance their functionality. Each project features interactive applications designed to be intuitive and accessible, even for those with minimal technical expertise.

## Key Apps:
1. Game One (Description Game): Provide a description, and the AI will give feedback based on the nature of the description.
2. Game Two (Selection Game): Select an option, and the AI will perform a task to entertain you.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or raise issues if you encounter any challenges!
