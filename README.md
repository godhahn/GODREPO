# GODREPO

**GODREPO** is a personal repository where I experiment and develop small projects during downtime. These mini-apps are built using **Python** and **Streamlit**, and many integrate with the **Groq API** and **LLaMA models** for intelligent interaction.

Each app is designed to be **interactive**, **fun**, and **user-friendly**, even for users with minimal technical background.

## Key Apps

1. **Game One: Description Game**  
   Provide a description, and the AI will analyze it and give feedback based on its tone, content, or creativity.  
   (Powered by LLaMA via the Groq API)

2. **Game Two: Selection Game**  
   Choose from a list of options, and the AI will perform a fun or entertaining task based on your selection.  
   (Powered by LLaMA via the Groq API)

3. **Game Three: Soccer Game**  
   A simple penalty shootout game â€” no AI involved.  
   - You choose a direction: **left**, **center**, or **right**.  
   - The goalkeeper (random logic) also chooses a direction.  
   - You score if your choice doesn't match the goalkeeper's!
