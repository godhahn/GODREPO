# AI Playground: Fun Streamlit WebApps with Groq + LLaMA

## Project Overview

This repository is a collection of interactive and experimental AI web applications built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and the **Groq API** (powered by **LLaMA models**). The goal is to have fun while building lightweight tools that demonstrate practical and playful uses of large language models (LLMs).

Each app is designed to be engaging, intuitive, and user-friendlyâ€”even for users with minimal technical background.

## Apps Overview (in `/pages`)
